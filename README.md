# Audio Voice-Over Analog Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements an **analog audio voice-over circuit** that prioritizes
microphone input over a primary audio source. Such systems are commonly used in
announcement systems and intercom applications.

In addition to circuit design, this project focuses on **mechanical enclosure
design** for practical device implementation.

## ⚙️ Features
- Dual audio input (Music + Microphone)
- Push-button activated voice-over priority
- Fully analog implementation (op-amps & transistors only)
- Echo suppression using analog techniques
- Custom-designed enclosure using SolidWorks

---

## 🔧 My Contribution
I was responsible for the **enclosure design of the device** using SolidWorks.

Through this project, I learned:
- Practical enclosure design for electronics
- Structural strengthening with minimal material usage
- Design optimization to reduce material wastage
- Integration of PCB and mechanical constraints

The enclosure was designed to provide sufficient strength while minimizing
material usage.
